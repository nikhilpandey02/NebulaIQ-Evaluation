### Blog Application
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/nikhilpandey02/BlogApplication)  
Tech stack: Spring Boot, Java, JPA, PostgreSQL, Spring Security

- Built a blog application using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL for backend.
- Designed database schema to store blog posts, users, and comments.
- Implemented features allowing users to add, edit, and delete their comments and posts.
- Integrated login and security features so users can safely access the application.
- Created search and filter functionalities to find posts by title, author, or content.

### Magical Arena
Tech stack: Java, Spring Boot

- Developed a game where two players play simultaneously with attributes such as strength, dice, health, and attack.
- A player is randomly chosen to start; players roll dice and attack each other in turns.
- The player whose health drops below zero loses the game.

## Areas of Strength
- Enjoy tackling more complex problems; passionate about debugging and finding bugs.
- Strong ability to learn new technologies quickly and apply them effectively.

## Areas to Improve
- Need to work on time management to optimize productivity.
- Improving deeper understanding of advanced data structures and algorithms.

# Work Style and Learning Preferences
- Learning Mode: Prefer reading documentation, watching tutorial videos, and doing practical projects.
- Problem-Solving Approach:
  - Read the problem description carefully and highlight important points.
  - Understand examples through dry runs and try brute force solutions first.
  - Optimize by identifying appropriate data structures and analyzing time complexity.

## Communication Preferences
- Prefer to communicate via Slack and email.

## Handling Ambiguity
- First step is to clearly understand the requirements and ask clarifying questions.
- Create well-documented, information-rich specifications or prototypes to resolve uncertainties.

## Independent vs Collaborative Work
- Comfortable working independently and collaboratively in a team.

# Mentorship and Expectations
- Interested in understanding product context, core customers, and stakeholder expectations.
